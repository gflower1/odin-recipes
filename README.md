# odin-recipes

This project is intended to build a basic recipe website as the first project assignment from The Odin Project.

The website will consist of a mian index page which will have links to a few recipes.
It won't look very pretty by the time I've finished, unless you're into brutalist web design.

But this project is just to build my HTML chops; i will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
