<p>This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled and they're perfect!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
    <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
</ul>



<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill.</li>
    <li>Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks.</li>
    <li>Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey.</li>
    <li>Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was.</li>
